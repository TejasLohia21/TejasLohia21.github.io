My life so far.
------
Born in an Agrawal family and brought up in Pune. Since, childhood I was driven by the hunger to understand the principles of how things work. My curiosity was further propelled by the research institutes in Pune such as IISER Pune, IUCAA pune and a few more, which I visited during my school days. 

In 8th Standard, I joined the prestigious mathematics institute for Olympiad preparation, the M. Prakash Institute, where the teachers further made me curious to explore not only maths, but the physics.

During the next two years, I went on to explore various concepts of physics from the famous Feynman Lectures, a few lectures by Prof. Walter Lewin, and some books on the very intriguing topic of Quantum Entanglement. 

In 11th grade, I navigated my JEE preparation at IITians Prashikshan Kendra in Pune and successfully conquered one of the most challenging exams, JEE Advanced 2023, securing an All India Rank of 3703, which led me to IIT Gandhinagar in Electrical Engineering

After the first year I received branch change to Computer Science and Engineering, based on academic excellence in the first year.



What is my passion?
------
**Astrophotography**: Something, which keeps me awake at night, while making me lost in the darkness of the universe. I have been an amateur astrophotographer for the past 4 years, and have been exploring the dark skies with my camera. Started this journey in collaboration with Jyotirvidya Parisanstha, Pune.

Not only the capturing, but also the image processing techniques have been a part of my learning journey.

**Badminton:** I have been a badminton enthusiast, and have been playing the sport since my school days.

**Reading:** I have been an avid reader of books, which present me the history and evolution of science, as they not only provide me the knowledge, but also the inspiration, and the thinking process of the scientists. One of the favorites being, "Through two doors at once" by Anil Ananthaswamy.

**Exploring Corals:** Having dived twice into the very beautiful corals of Andaman, but with a gap of 10 years, made me introspect of how we have damaged this hidden beauty beneath the oceans. This made me curious to explore the world of corals, and am willing to contribute to the conservation of the same.
